# Localization

Server pages and the admin UI can be localized for cultures you need.

## Cultures

![cultures](assets/cultures.png)  

The default culture is **en**. When you add a new culture, a language selector appears in the admin UI.

> The server must be restarted to take the new culture in charge.

In the culture page you can translate english string resources used by the server or the application.

The application doesn't provide a list of key but instead a warning log is written each time a key is not found for a specific culture.

In the browser console for application resources

## Application Welcome screen

When the application setting `welcomeContenUrl` = */api/welcomefragment*

```json
"welcomeContenUrl": "/api/welcomefragment"
```

The API will look for a file named *{EnvironmentName}-welcome-fragment.{CultureName}.html* in the *wwwroot* folder  
and fallback to *{EnvironmentName}-welcome-fragment.html*  
then to *welcome-fragment.{CultureName}.html*  
then to *welcome-fragment.html*

## Culture cookie

Any request to the server containing the query string *culture={CultureName}* set the culture cookie to the desired culture.
