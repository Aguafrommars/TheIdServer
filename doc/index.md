> [OpenID/Connect](https://openid.net/connect/), [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/), [WS-Federation](https://docs.oasis-open.org/wsfed/federation/v1.2/os/ws-federation-1.2-spec-os.html) and [SAML 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/sstc-saml-approved-errata-2.0.html) are protocols that enable secure authentication and authorization of users and applications on the web. They allow users to sign in with their existing credentials from an identity provider (such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter ans so-on) and grant access to their data and resources on different platforms and services. These protocols also enable developers to create applications that can interact with various APIs and resources without exposing the userâ€™s credentials or compromising their privacy. Some examples of applications that use these protocols are web browsers, mobile apps, web APIs, and single-page applications.
